# MCDiff
Tool for creating and applying diffs from Minecraft region files.

MCDiff allows two mca files (Minecraft region files) to be compared, with the difference output to a file ( .mcad). This difference file can be applied to the source mca file.

This was to be used in a piece of software allowing minecraft servers to be hosted in a peer-to-peer context. A machine would host the Minecraft world, download all the required deltas and apply them.

This was developed back in 2014 for the Java version of Miencraft, it has not been tested with recent versions.
